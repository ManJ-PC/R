This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(scales)
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
# Assuming you have a dataset named 'df' and want to remove outliers from the 'target_price_eur' column

# Calculate the lower and upper whiskers using the IQR method
Q1 <- quantile(df$target_price_eur, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(df$target_price_eur, 0.75)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1
lower_whisker <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_whisker <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# Remove outliers from the 'target_price_eur' column
df <- df[df$target_price_eur >= lower_whisker & df$target_price_eur <= upper_whisker, ]
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
